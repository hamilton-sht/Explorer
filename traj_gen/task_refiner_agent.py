    Do the following step by step:
    1. Please predict what action the user might perform next that is consistent with the overall task and previous action list in natural language.
    2. Then based on the parsed HTML/accessibility tree of the webpage and the natural language action, generate the grounded action.
    3. Update the overall task aligned with this set of actions.


    *  Task update rules *

    1. The task must contain some actions: "Buy, Book, Find, Check, Choose show me, give me, add to cart, ...', ideally invovling transactions with a specific product or service. If possible, avoid information seeking tasks like "explore, review, read" etc. 
    2. You should only propose tasks that do not require login to execute the task.
    3. You should propose tasks that are clear and specific, e.g. it should contain details like "buy/book something under $100", "find a product with 4 stars" etc.
    4. Update the details of the task, such price, date, location, etc. based on the current set of actions and the proposed action.
    5. The updated task must remain solvable. It should be possible to complete the task using the available website/app interface, and it should not require finding an item, product, service, or option that does not exist.

    *ACTION SPACE*: Your action space is: [`click [element ID]`, `type [element ID] [content]`, `select [element ID] [content of option to select]`, `scroll [up]`, `scroll [down]`, and `stop`].
    Action output should follow the syntax as given below:
    `click [element ID]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.
    `type [element ID] [content]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing. Both the content and the id should be within square braces as per the syntax.
    `select [element ID] [content of option to select]`: Select an option from a dropdown menu. The content of the option to select should be within square braces. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree , you need to select the serial number (element_id) corresponding to the select tag , not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as input.
    `scroll [down]`: Scroll the page down. 
    `scroll [up]`: Scroll the page up.

    *IMPORTANT* To be successful, it is important to STRICTLY follow the below rules:

    *  Action generation rules *
    1. You should generate a single atomic action at each step.
    2. The action should be an atomic action from the given action space - click, type, scroll (up or down) or stop
    3. The arguments to each action should be within square braces. For example, "click [127]", "type [43] [content to type]", "scroll [up]", "scroll [down]".
    4. The natural language form of action (corresponding to the field "action_in_natural_language") should be consistent with the grounded version of the action (corresponding to the field "grounded_action"). Do NOT add any additional information in the grounded action. For example, if a particular element ID is specified in the grounded action, a description of that element must be present in the natural language action. 
    5. If the type action is selected, the natural language form of action ("action_in_natural_language") should always specify the actual text to be typed. 
    6. You should issue a “stop” action if the current webpage asks to login or for credit card information. 
    7. To input text, there is NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits the `ENTER` key.
    8. STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action (click/type) if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element.
    9. If you cannot identify a valid visible text input or search box in the current parsed HTML/accessibility tree, do not output a type action. Use click or scroll instead.
    10. Do NOT use quotation marks in the action generation.

    The output should be in below format:
    *OUTPUT FORMAT*: Please give a short analysis of the screenshot, parsed HTML/accessibility tree, and history, then put your answer within ``` ```, for example, "In summary, the proposed task and the corresponding action is: ```{{"task": <TASK>:str, "action_in_natural_language":<ACTION_IN_NATURAL_LANGUAGE>:str, "grounded_action": <ACTION>:str}}```"
